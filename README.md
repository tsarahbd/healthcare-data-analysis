# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis: A Comprehensive Study  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing **healthcare indicators** across various countries over time. The dataset includes critical metrics such as:  

- **Life Expectancy**  
- **Hospital Beds per 1,000 People**  
- **Doctors per 1,000 People**  
- **Healthcare Spending (% of GDP)**  
- **Infant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 births)**  

### 🔍 **Objectives:**  
✅ Understand trends in **life expectancy** from 1990–2020.  
✅ Examine the availability of **hospital beds and doctors per 1,000 people**.  
✅ Analyze **infant mortality rates** and **healthcare spending trends**.  
✅ Explore correlations between **healthcare infrastructure and life expectancy**.  

This project demonstrates my skills in **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.**

## 🛠 **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
Before analysis, I performed the following preprocessing steps:  

✔ **Handled missing values** by forward-filling and imputing reasonable estimates.  
✔ **Converted data types** (e.g., Year to categorical for proper plotting).  
✔ **Addressed infinite values** by replacing.
✔ **Standardized country names** and removed inconsistencies.  
✔ **Checked for outliers** using summary statistics and visualizations.

## 📊 **Visualizations in Tableau**

I leveraged **Tableau** to create an **interactive dashboard** for analyzing global healthcare data from 1990 to 2020. Using **data visualization techniques**, I successfully represented life expectancy trends, healthcare spending patterns, and the availability of hospital beds and doctors per 1,000 people across different countries. I built **KPI cards**, **bar plots**, **scatter plots**, and **line graphs**, while integrating *filters and slicers* for dynamic exploration. By applying data modeling techniques, I connected multiple charts and allowed cross-filtering between different metrics. This not only enhanced data storytelling but also provided actionable insights into healthcare infrastructure and its impact on life expectancy. Through this work, I demonstrated my expertise in *data visualization*, *dashboard design*, and *advanced filtering techniques in Tableau*.

## 📊 **Visualizations in PowerBI**

I utilized **Power BI** to create an interactive dashboard for analyzing global healthcare indicators over time. I designed **KPI cards** to highlight key metrics like Life Expectancy, Hospital Beds per 1,000 People, and Doctors per 1,000 People. Using **line charts**, **bar plots**, and **scatter plots**, I visualized trends in life expectancy, correlation between healthcare spending and infant mortality, and country-wise healthcare infrastructure comparisons. I incorporated *slicers* and *filters* to make the dashboard dynamic and user-friendly. This project demonstrates my skills in **data modeling**, **DAX functions**, and **effective dashboard design in Power BI**.
