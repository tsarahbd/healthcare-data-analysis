# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis: A Comprehensive Study  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing **healthcare indicators** across various countries over time. The dataset includes critical metrics such as:  

- **Life Expectancy**  
- **Hospital Beds per 1,000 People**  
- **Doctors per 1,000 People**  
- **Healthcare Spending (% of GDP)**  
- **Infant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 births)**  

### 🔍 **Objectives:**  
✅ Understand trends in **life expectancy** from 1990–2020.  
✅ Examine the availability of **hospital beds and doctors per 1,000 people**.  
✅ Analyze **infant mortality rates** and **healthcare spending trends**.  
✅ Explore correlations between **healthcare infrastructure and life expectancy**.  

This project demonstrates my skills in **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.**

## 🛠 **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
Before analysis, I performed the following preprocessing steps:  

✔ **Handled missing values** by forward-filling and imputing reasonable estimates.  
✔ **Converted data types** (e.g., Year to categorical for proper plotting).  
✔ **Addressed infinite values** by replacing.
✔ **Standardized country names** and removed inconsistencies.  
✔ **Checked for outliers** using summary statistics and visualizations.

## 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
### 🔹 **Key Findings:**  

📌 **Life Expectancy Trends**  
- Life expectancy has generally **increased from 1990 to 2020**, reflecting improvements in healthcare systems.  
- Developed countries show a **higher life expectancy** compared to developing nations.  

📌 **Hospital Beds & Doctors Per 1,000 People**  
- Some countries have **high numbers of hospital beds** but a **lower doctor-to-patient ratio**.  
- Countries with **fewer hospital beds** tend to compensate with **higher healthcare spending**.  

📌 **Infant Mortality vs. Healthcare Spending**  
- A **negative correlation** was observed—**higher healthcare spending** is linked to **lower infant mortality rates**.  

📌 **Correlation Analysis**  
- Life expectancy is **positively correlated** with the number of doctors per 1,000 people.  
- **Infant mortality rates are negatively correlated** with life expectancy and healthcare spending.

## 📈 **Visualizations Used**  
✔ **Bar plots & line plots** to analyze trends over time.  
✔ **Heatmaps** for correlation analysis.  
✔ **Stacked bar charts** for country-wise comparisons.
